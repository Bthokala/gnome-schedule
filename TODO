* release majors once a month



Add window:
* Regexp to check if the values entered in the advaced add form is correct.
* Move the value from the advaced form into the advanced help form when shown
	- Try to parse the values and select a radiobutton if possible
* No '> /dev/null..' stuff in the command entry, only in the preview label
	- perhaps a label next to the entry

* if 'use advanced' is selected then jumb to advaced adding
* set up a bugzilla
* the 'Setting' label should be a header
* the combobox 'Every' should not be editable, perhaps change to a normal combobox

Add help window:
* if >1 is selected in the select every field is written then change the label to 'dayS' or appropiate
* and 'Happends from' should be changed to 'Happends from day' [ ] to [ ]
* 'happends all days' should be 'happends every day'
* the 'Expression' label should be a header.

Documentation:
