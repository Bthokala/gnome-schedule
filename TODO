 Unassigned release blockers

freax: small problem in the preset system
freax: when you remove the t of preset
freax: and type a new t
freax: then the save button is enabled
freax: you can save it and that will work, however
freax: when you select it
freax: the save button wont ever get enabled again
freax: but the delete but will
freax: (luckily)
freax: Both in the atEditor and crontabEditor

 Unassigned unstable (need a new branch and/or will not be 
 included in the next release)
  * Unification of the atEditor and crontabEditor GUI
    One editor to rule them all!
  * Support for mail direction in both cron and at
  * Support for classes in at(nice, priority)
  * Somehow detect the removal of a record (both at and crontab)
    o. For example detect when an at-record will expire
    o. Check for crontab records every minute?
    o. Use fam to detect changes in the config-files of crontab and at?
  * Include a default icon for at, and a default icon for crontab
    and also make it the default-selected icon

 Unassigned would make it to the release but are non-blocking it
  * Documentation
  * All times: Code cleanups, refactoring, bugfixes
  * We need more exception handlers and let functions return if an operation failed
    (in savetemplate for example)


Documentation:
  * Write it (we can use some help here)

Translations:
  * Virtually any possible language 
  * Also checkout the lang.py file!

Build System
  * remove mkinstalldirs when not needed anymore
  * add python version check to configure.ac
