Remember to send an email to the gnome-schedule-devel list
or check out the latest code from the subversion repository
in case work has allready been started on some of the features.

This list has a tendency to get outdated and forgotten.

Development:
* labels should be expanded

 Wishlist (need a new branch and/or will not be included in the next release)
  * Show the next-run time for crontab records
  * Support for mail direction in both cron and at
  * Support for classes in at(nice, priority)
  * make task for more then one user at once (for a group of users)
  * add logging function? (http://docs.python.org/lib/module-logging.html)	 
  * "gnome-schedule --addtemplate foo" (will add a template) (console only)
  * "gnome-schedule --addtask task user" (will add a task for a user) (console only) 
    http://docs.python.org/lib/module-getopt.html
    
    
 Unassigned would make it to the release but are non-blocking it
  * We need more exception handlers and let functions return if an operation failed
    (in savetemplate for example)

Translations:
  * Check out the ngettext stuff for python, perhaps send python/gettext folks a note about the missing features. bug 325053
  * Virtually any possible language 
  * Also checkout the lang.py file!
  * Some of the translations are so outdated, and wrong that they hardly should be there.. ie: pa.po

Build System
  * add python version check to configure.ac
