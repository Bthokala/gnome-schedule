  * Documentation
  * All times: Code cleanups, refactoring, bugfixes
  * We need more exception handlers and let functions return if an operation failed
    (in savetemplate for example)
  * look into (to see what could be interresting to use in our project):
  	 http://docs.python.org/lib/module-locale.html 
	 http://docs.python.org/lib/module-calendar.html 
	 http://docs.python.org/lib/module-datetime.html
	 http://docs.python.org/lib/module-grp.html
