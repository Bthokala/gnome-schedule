Introducion:
(Not that is going to be anything more than an introduction)
This is the first python or gtk application i write, have only known it for three days.
So bear with me.



Installation:


It should work with most crontabs since it doesn't edit the crontab itself but creates a file and runs 'crontab' with the file as an argument. To get the current crontab it reads 'crontab -l' into a file and reads the file line for line.

At configuration works pretty much the same way.

All the temporary files is located in /tmp and is deleted afterwards.

Help on features:
Writing out crontab. This writes out the crontab to the file /tmp/crontab
It is meant to be used in case the crontab is to be installed on another machine and you want to configure it with this tool


Download:
You can, for now, get the latest version at: http://gaute.eu.org/stasj/cronconf/
