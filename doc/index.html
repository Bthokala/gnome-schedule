<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>System schedule configurator is a tool made to help the configuration of the crontab server and 'at' configuration easier. The crontab server runs commands at specified times such as every month at the 12th 12:00, or at every Tuesday<br>
'at' runs specified commands at(therefor the name) a specified time.<br><br>If you were to configure crontab manually you would have to write a line like "* * * * 2 command" for every tuesday.<br><br>Explanation:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td><b>Minute</b></td><td><b>Hour</b></td><td><b>Day</b></td><td><b>Month</b></td><td><b>Weekday</b></td><td><b>Command</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>2</td><td>command</td></tr>
</table>
See 'man crontab(5)' for more.<br>
This is parsed into easy to read lines such as "Every tuesday" if possible(if not it is shown as this). And you can add titles and edit them and have full control in a listview.
</p>
<br><br>
If you were to configure 'at' manually you would have to write something like:<br>
<code>
at tomorrow<br>
>ls (commands)<br>
> Ctrl + D<br><br>
and 'ls' would be executed tomorrow at this time.<br>
You can see the queued jobs by executing 'atq', and you can view the contents of a job by 'at -c job_id'(you get the jobid by running atq). You can remove at jobs with 'atrm job_id'.<br>
'batch' is also part of at and runs commands at a specified time when the system resources is low enough(specified).<br>
<br>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The main purposes of this application is to create a graphical interface for the user who doesn't know much about crontab and present the records in a way that would be easy to understand for everyone.<br>We have choosen to have an advanced option to make the tool useful for the experienced user aswell, for those that only could use an overview of the crontab and easily manage many different users crontabs. In the advaced mode the records is not parsed and are shown as they would look in the crontab file.</p>
