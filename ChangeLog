2007-11-15  Gaute Hope  <eg@gaute.vetsj.com>

	* src/crontabEditorHelper.py: Changed window title to type: "Edit minute", re-translation needed.
	* src/gnome-schedule.glade, src/crontabEditorHelper.py, po/fr.po: Applied Kiddo's changes, they are as follows:
	* simplified the crontab helper dialog (minutes editor for example) to the extreme. My reasoning is this: you don't need a label to indicate that it's all about minutes because a) the user just clicked an edit button at the right of the Minutes field b) this should be in the window title anyway (this needs to be implemented: replace the window title for something relevant), and c) this adds visual clutter. The net result from removing this label is that now, there is no more reason to "indent" the rest of the dialog, so a whole bunch of GTK widgets can be removed. Much simpler :)
	* fix the spacings everywhere to be HIG-compliant (lien). 12px around dialogs, 6 or 12 pixels spacings pretty much everywhere, realign stuff
	* in the addWindow dialog, simplify the wording of the choices. It was too redundant (the text was not a useful read for the user)
	* make the crontab_editor "resize-friendly"
	* switch stuff around in the crontab_editor
	* change some terms (i.e.: task --> command)
	
2007-11-14  Gaute Hope  <eg@gaute.vetsj.com>

	* new crontab editor fully works
	* deleted old one
	* new field to the main treemodel for timestring_advanced; the timestring shown in advanced mode. Effectively only affecting @reboot entries now showing _("At reboot") and not 5 x @reboot
	* advanced view toggle button behaves
	* set version to 2.0.0-BETA
	* remembers size and position, but not state due to silly gtk/gnome
	* removed support.py, translates thoughicon.py
	* src/gnome-schedule.glade: Formatting changed of entire file while switching to glade-3
	* added kiddos changes

2007-04-27  Gaute Hope  <eg@gaute.vetsj.com>

	* added nooutput field to the crontab datafiles to fix parsing error and not having to parse the crontab line to figure out if it is inteneded to have no output
	* got problems with the at parser in this case and created a new regexp, using datetime to create a datetime object out of the complete date/time string parsed out of atq's output, the new regexp is number 3. Still struggeling to figure out how to make atq output predictable in all versions.
	* added a new field to the treemodel created in mainWindow.py to keep the nooutput field. Also added a new gconf field for the nooutput field. Updated template handelers in the editors. at does not use the nooutput option, but since they are both using the same backend for some reason it needs to specify and load aswell this, send and recieve bogus.
	* at the moment quite some debug that will be removed after some testing.

	the first arguement uses it for the username. Otherwise it users the 
	USER environment variable.

	installing it, so that it can be installed on another machine
	(ie: a server without X)
	* Fixed some version numbers.
	* realized you had to be root to use the 'crontab -u' command, so now 
	it only works if you are modifying root's crontab.. i tend to fix it 
	to use the environment variable to check for user id or something.
