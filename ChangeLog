	the first arguement uses it for the username. Otherwise it users the 
	USER environment variable.

	installing it, so that it can be installed on another machine
	(ie: a server without X)
	* Fixed some version numbers.
	* realized you had to be root to use the 'crontab -u' command, so now 
	it only works if you are modifying root's crontab.. i tend to fix it 
	to use the environment variable to check for user id or something.
