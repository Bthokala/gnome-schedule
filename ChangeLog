	* configure.ac, autogen.sh, Makefile.am: Reconfiguration of the build
	environment. This build environment used to be Fedora-only. From now
	on this build environment needs to be suitable for any Unix platform
	on which GNOME has been implemented. The status of this is unfinished
	and yes, I can use some help with all this :).
	* ChangeLog: Reflowed the ChangeLog.
	* Further preparations, general build environment changes	
	* COPYING: Added the proper license file

	* configure.ac: Changed GETTEXT_PACKAGE from "atomix" to
	"gnome-schedule". Also added "sv" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-13  Philip Van Hoof  <me_NOSPAM@freax.org>

	* Added translatable string stuff _("translate this") at various places

	* addWindow.py: Regexp stuff to check if the values entered in the 
	advaced add form is correct. No '> /dev/null..' stuff in the 
	command entry (used a label). Redesign of the 'Setting' label. 
	The combobox 'Every' is now read-only

	* addWindowHelp.py: if >1 is selected in the select every field is 
	written then change the label to 'dayS' or  appropiate and 
	'Happends from' is changed to 'Happends from day' [ ] to [ ] 
	'happends all days' is 'happends every day'. Redesign of the 
	'Expression' label

	* Removed most of the debugging messages i used before.

2004-06-03  Gaute Hope  <eg_NOSPAM@gaute.eu.org>

	* used the environment provided by Philip Van Hoof, modified the 
	makefile a bit(changed project directory) and the claen now 
	cleans the *~ files in the src/ dir aswell
	* you may change to advanced mode at the settings menu, simple 
	is default
	* created the simple model
	* created the update function, and some simple parse function
	* changed the name to Crontab manager
	* created the simple add form
	* added a viewport and a slide pane and hides the cronjob_edit frame 
	when simple mode is selected.
	* made simple add work
	* made simple remove work, should be sufficient for editing for now. 
	If you want to do that you should switch to advanced mode.

2004-06-01  Gaute Hope  <eg_NOSPAM@gaute.eu.org>

	* Fixed the user selecting with commandline argument, it now only 
	works if the UID = 0
	* Bug: Made it work with other users than root :)

2004-05-31  Gaute Hope  <eg_NOSPAM@gaute.eu.org>

	* Added support for editing crontab for other users. It now checks for 
	the first arguement uses it for the username. Otherwise it users the 
	USER environment variable.
	* Made it possible to just write out the crontab file without 
	installing it, so that it can be installed on another machine
	(ie: a server without X)
	* Fixed some version numbers.
	* realized you had to be root to use the 'crontab -u' command, so now 
	it only works if you are modifying root's crontab.. i tend to fix it 
	to use the environment variable to check for user id or something.

2004-05-30  Gaute Hope  <eg_NOSPAM@gaute.eu.org>

	* Made it interfere with crontab using the crontab command to list 
	and write crontabs

	expressions
