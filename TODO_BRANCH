Do we need templates?

Templates:
        - A template manager with a list of templates. Where you:
          a) Can delete templates
          b) Can edit templates
          c) Get explained that you need to add templates through the editors
          d) Can add tasks based on template

        - A New from Template option where you:
          a) Get a list of templates, the list here and in the template manager should look about the same
          b) The list has an icon corresponding to the type it belongs to
          c) It show a preview like in the main window
          d) Includes time expressions and the rest of the relevant information stored

        - The editors need support for editing a template
          a) They need a third output option where they replace the existing template
