        It is time for the (most likely) last release in the 1.x series, there are fairly few updates since the recent 1.2.0 release, but although it was meant as a last translation update I found some significant bugs.

A summary of the Changelog:
  ∘ Fixed bug in the at editor: choosing dates in the future with a month or day before the current one failed
  ∘ Fixed some parsing bugs in crontab regarding short term strings in the time expressions (mon, tue, wed)
  ∘ Fixed some confusing simple expressions regarding weekdays
  ∘ Removed debug messages
  ∘ Fixed help open function
  ∘ Fixed an error in the dialog that pops up if a record is invalid


Other than that it might be worth saying that since this file was updated the last time versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.2.0 has been released.

Other than that it is not much to say about this one. Happy scheduling!
